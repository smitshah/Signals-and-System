## Operations on signals

**Q1. Perform the following tasks with graph:-**

1. Add two continuous time sinusoidal signals with some different time periods. Also multiply
the same signals.

2. Perform time shifting, time reversal and time scaling on continuous time elementary
signals.

3. Add two sequences {1,2,3,4,5} and {3,4,5,6,7}. Also multiply the given sequences.

4. Perform Task 2 in discrete time.

5. Find even and odd component of a sequence {1,2,3,4,5}.


**Q2. Plot the signals, x(t) = u(t) - u(t-4) and perform the following operations.**

1. Plot x(t)

2. Fold x(t)

3. Differentiate x(t)

4. Integrate x(t)

5. Plot a sine wave y(t) and multiply it with x(t)

6. Compress the signal x(t) by a factor of 2

7. Expand the signal x(t) by a factor of 1.5

8. Divide the signal y(t) by the compressed signal
